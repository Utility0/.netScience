### Betweenness

Betweenness Centrality of a Node is given by:
For each couples of nodes. Compute the number of shortest path passing through v and the total number of shortest path between s and t (s!=v!=t).

Make the sum for each couple of the ratio #shortest passing through v and #shortset

### Closeness

Closenessis the inverse of the sum of the size of the shortest path between the computed node and all the other nodes

### Degree

number of edges linked to this node.

### Katz

Similar to degree but with attenuation.

#at_dist=1 + attenuation*#at_dist=2 + attenuation^2*#at_dist=3+ attenuation^3*#at_dist=4+ attenuation^4*#at_dist=5
